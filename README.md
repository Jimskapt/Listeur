# Listeur
A tiny software to scan recursively a folder an extract it to an Excel file

Sorry it's a dirty job i've done quickly a couple of months ago.

But it works (tested on Windows 7, in fact), so I just want to share it, in hope it can help someone !

It uses principaly the great Apache POI library to generate .xlsx files.


It needs a lot of improvements, principaly :
- i13n (it's only in french to the moment ...)
- JavaFX
- ods & co files
